Preparation:
  project: The sample project "sample.proj" is supplied as a way of demonstrating the "PID"
           block. The window "PIDControl" may be used to change set points to observe the 
           block control the value to match.
           Necessary tags may be created by importing data/sqltags.xml. Datapump control
           tags must be created manually under the default provider, DataPump folder.
           Tags are: command, state, and line. The last is an int4, the others, string.

           The sample diagram may be easily re-constituted by importing data/PID.json.
  gateway: To use the sample project "as-is":
             1) Create a connection to a database for maintaining history. Call it "history".
                This is required only because we use a historical chart.
             2) Create a new SQL Tag Provider (a standard tag provider). Call it "PID" and 
                set its default database to "history".
             3) Configure the data pump with a tag folder name: [PD]PID/. 
                Appropriate data is in data/PID.csv. 
  icons:   In the Designer, launch the ImageManagement tool. Drag and drop images/BNC to 
           into the root workspace of the ImageManagement tool. This will load into Ignition
           all icons necessary to display the blocks defined in the project. No icons will
           appear in the palette until the project is re-started. Without these icons the 
           palette will be empty.
